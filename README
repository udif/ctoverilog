This is a fork of the code from www.c-to-verilog.com

The original code was written by Nadav Rotem.

Since the original code was not released under any form of source code control, and has not advanced for some time, I moved it to a public GIT repository in order to advance it further.
Near term goals are to update the code to the latest LLVM relase (currently the code requires LLVM 2.5).
